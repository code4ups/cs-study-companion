# A1 ‚Äì Computer Fundamentals

<GuidingQuestion lang="en">
  What principles explain how a computer operates, from the smallest hardware functions to the way it communicates with its operating system?
</GuidingQuestion>


Welcome to the world of computer science! In this section, you will explore how a computer system really works beneath the surface. You may already use a computer daily‚Äîto write, play games, browse the internet, listen to music, or connect with friends. But now, it is time to pause and ask deeper questions.

**How is it possible for a computer to render realistic graphics in a video game?**
**How can music and images be represented by nothing more than 1s and 0s?**
**How does a video stream across the world almost instantly?**

Computer scientists aim to uncover and explain these hidden mechanisms. They investigate the fundamental building blocks of a system‚Äîwhether that is hardware components such as processors and memory, or the software processes that manage them.

When you begin to ask, _‚ÄúBut how does this actually work?‚Äù_, you are starting to develop the mindset of a computer scientist. This is your opportunity to think critically, explore concepts in depth, and begin your journey of inquiry.
