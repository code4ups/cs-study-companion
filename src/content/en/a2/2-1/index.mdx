## A2.1.1 Purpose and characteristics of networks

There are many types of networks, each with different uses. Networks may share features but have very different goals.

---

## Local Area Network (LAN)

Connects devices in a limited area (usually up to ~1 km) with **high transmission speed** and **low latency**.
**Purpose:** sharing local resources such as printers, files, and applications.
**Examples:** schools, offices, hospitals.

---

## Wide Area Network (WAN)

Connects cities or countries, usually with **slower speeds** and **higher latency** than LANs.
**Purpose:** interconnect multiple LANs over large distances.
**Implemented via:** leased lines, VPNs, satellites.

---

## Personal Area Network (PAN)

Connects personal devices (phones, tablets, smartwatches) within ~10 metres.
**Technologies:** Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct

---

## Virtual Private Network (VPN)

Extends a private network over the public Internet using **encryption**.
**Uses:** remote work, privacy, bypassing geographical restrictions.

<KeyTerm lang="en">
**IP address (IPv4):** 32-bit number written in dotted decimal format (e.g. `192.168.1.1`) using four 8-bit octets.
