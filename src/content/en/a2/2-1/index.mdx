    # A2.1 Network fundamentals

    ### Learning objectives
    - **A2.1.1** Describe the purpose and characteristics of networks
    - **A2.1.2** Describe the purpose, benefits and limitations of modern digital infrastructures
    - **A2.1.3** Describe the function of networking devices
    - **A2.1.4** Describe protocols used at the transport and application layers
    - **A2.1.5** Describe the TCP/IP model

    Digital networks are essential to modern life and business. Many organizations cannot operate without them.

    ## A2.1.1 Purpose and characteristics of networks

    There are many network types with different purposes. They may share characteristics but serve distinct use cases.

    ---

    ## Local Area Network (LAN)

    Connects devices over a **short distance** (typically up to ~1 km) with **high throughput** and **low latency**. It can be wired, wireless, or hybrid.

    **Purpose:** resource sharing (printers, files, apps) within a local environment.
    **Examples:** schools, offices, hospitals, hotels, restaurants.

    ---

    ## Wide Area Network (WAN)

    Spans **large distances** across cities/countries/continents. Typically **lower throughput** and **higher latency** than LAN.

    **Purpose:** interconnect many local networks to operate at global scale.
    **Implementation:** leased lines, satellite links, VPNs, fiber, wireless backhaul.

    ---

    ## Personal Area Network (PAN)

    Links **personal devices** (phone, tablet, smartwatch) over ~10 m.

    **Uses:** deviceâ€‘toâ€‘device communication, syncing, audio streaming, fitness tracking.
    **Technologies:** Bluetooth, Wiâ€‘Fi Direct.

    ---

    ## Virtual Private Network (VPN)

    Extends a private network over the public Internet with **encryption**.

    **Uses:**
    - secure remote work (access to corporate resources),
    - privacy (hide IP address),
    - bypass geoâ€‘restrictions.

    ---

    ### ðŸ”‘ Key term
    **IP address (IPv4):** 32â€‘bit number in dottedâ€‘decimal (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) formed by four 8â€‘bit octets.

    ---

    ## ðŸ“˜ Practice questions

    1) Name two network types designed for short distances.
    2) What is the primary purpose of a VPN?
    3) **a.** Describe how a WAN operates. **b.** Give one realâ€‘world example.
    4) **a.** Describe the characteristics of a PAN. **b.** Provide a practical use case.
    5) List advantages of using a LAN in an enterprise environment.
