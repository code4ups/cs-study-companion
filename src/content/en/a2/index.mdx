# A2 â€“ Networks

<GuidingQuestion lang="en">
  What makes it possible for computers and devices to communicate with each other across networks around the world?
</GuidingQuestion>


When working with computers, most users rarely think about the technology that allows them to connect with others or access information online. Networks are often taken for granted: a device connects to Wi-Fi and "just works." Yet, beneath this simplicity lies a complex structure of rules, protocols, and hardware that make communication possible.

As a computer scientist, your role is to explore how these systems function.
**What exactly is an IP address, and why is it necessary?**
**How can internet traffic be tracked, and what limitations exist to protect privacy?**
**How do domain names get translated into IP addresses?**
**What challenges are created by IP address shortages, and how do protocols ensure data is delivered reliably across the globe?**

It is remarkable that a message can travel across continents and return with a response in less than a second. By investigating these processes, you will deepen your understanding of networks, hardware, and the protocols that sustain global communication.
