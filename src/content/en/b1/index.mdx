    # B1 – Computational Thinking

    ### In what ways can we apply computational methods to solve real-world challenges?

    ---

    Computer scientists approach problems by using computational thinking. This way of thinking involves a collection of problem-solving strategies such as abstraction, algorithmic design, decomposition, and pattern recognition. By applying these techniques, complex issues can be broken down, understood more clearly, and solved more effectively.

    Computational thinking demands precise reasoning, attentive listening, and thorough comprehension. Once the nature of a problem is fully grasped, the process of designing a solution can begin.
