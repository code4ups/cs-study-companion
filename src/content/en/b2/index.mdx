    In what ways can computer programming be applied to address and solve problems?
    </GuidingQuestion>

    During your computer science studies and in real-world practice, you will encounter many problems that require solutions. By analyzing the different aspects of a problem and identifying the appropriate tools, you can begin to design programs that provide solutions. For instance, when you need to make a decision, you can use *IF* statements. When a process requires repeating steps, loops become essential.

    This section will guide you through the programming techniques and tools available, helping you to apply them effectively in solving a variety of challenges.
