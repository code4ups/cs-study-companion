    # B3 – Object-oriented Programming

    ### Is object-oriented programming (OOP) a suitable paradigm for addressing and solving complex problems?

    ---

    When creating programs, developers often aim to represent the real world, not as a set of unrelated attributes, but as entities known as objects, which bring together both attributes and behaviours.

    Object-oriented programming (OOP) allows you to model these objects in a way that reflects how we perceive them in reality, where data and behaviours are neatly encapsulated within the same object. This approach frequently simplifies the process of tackling complex problems. In this topic, you will explore how objects function in programming and how they help us represent the world in a more structured and realistic manner.
