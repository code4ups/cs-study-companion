        <p><strong>Welcome to the CS Study Companion</strong></p>

        <p>The CS Study Companion is your digital guide to mastering computer science. It has been designed as an online support tool that accompanies your main textbook, offering explanations, practice opportunities, and study strategies tailored to the needs of IB learners.</p>

        <p>Here, you will find structured guidance that connects computer science theory with real-world applications, while also building your computational thinking and problem-solving skills. The guide emphasizes self-management, resilience, and independent learning—qualities that will help you progress with confidence.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Syllabus structure</h2>

        <p>Topics are organized into two separate themes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theme A:</strong> Concepts of computer science</li>
            <li><strong>Theme B:</strong> Computational thinking and problem-solving</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These themes represent the connection between abstract ideas of how computing systems operate (Theme A)
            and their application using the practical skills of computer science to solve problems through the process
            of computational thinking (Theme B).

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Coding within the computer science journey</h2>

        <p>Learning to code can feel challenging at first, but it is also deeply rewarding. Everyone learns at their own pace, and the most important step is to keep practising. Coding is not just about writing lines of code—it is about developing problem-solving skills and the resilience to try again when things do not work the first time.</p>

        <p>This guide encourages you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Break down problems into smaller steps.</li>
            <li>Practise consistently through coding exercises.</li>
            <li>Use mistakes as opportunities to learn and grow.</li>
            <li>Combine theory with hands-on activities for stronger understanding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Self-management and study skills</h2>

        <p>Effective learning in computer science requires strong self-management. Organize your notes, keep track of common coding errors, and build a personal system for revision. By approaching your studies with discipline and creativity, you will find that progress becomes more natural and less stressful.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Where to get support</h2>

        <p>As you work through coding and computer science concepts, remember that support is available. Helpful resources include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Teachers and mentors.</li>
            <li>Online communities and coding forums.</li>
            <li>Study companions like this one, offering structured guidance.</li>

            <li><strong>Inquirers</strong> – exploring new ideas with curiosity.</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledgeable</strong> – building deep understanding across key areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Thinkers</strong> – analysing problems logically and creatively.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicators</strong> – sharing knowledge effectively with others.</li>
            <li><strong>Principled</strong> – acting with honesty and fairness.</li>
            <li><strong>Open-minded</strong> – respecting diverse perspectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Caring</strong> – showing empathy and responsibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk-takers</strong> – approaching challenges with courage.</li>
            <li><strong>Balanced</strong> – maintaining intellectual and emotional wellbeing.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflective</strong> – learning from your strengths and areas for improvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Academic integrity</h2>

        <p>In computer science, integrity is essential. Always credit the sources you use, whether they are books, code fragments, diagrams, or online resources. Your work should reflect your own understanding while acknowledging the contributions of others.</p>

        <p>Avoid plagiarism by properly citing ideas, text, and code. Avoid collusion by ensuring your work is authentically yours. By upholding integrity, you not only meet academic standards but also prepare for professional environments where trust and responsibility are fundamental.</p>

        <p>The CS Study Companion exists to support your learning in an ethical, engaging, and motivating way—helping you become not only a better coder, but also a thoughtful and responsible digital citizen.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-3">How to use CS Study Companion</h2>

        The aim of this study companion is to develop conceptual understanding, support skills development, and provide opportunities to consolidate knowledge through practice. The features of the companion are carefully designed to guide you through each topic, highlight connections with other areas, and prepare you for assessments. Some sections are directed at students working at higher level, while other features link directly to different parts of the guide to give you a broader perspective.

        ### Developing conceptual understanding

        **Guiding questions**
        Each topic begins with a guiding question to stimulate your thinking. At first, you may not be able to answer these questions fully, but as you progress through the topic, your understanding will deepen. Revisit these guiding questions as you revise to reflect on your learning.

        **Linking questions**
        Linking questions help you connect the ideas in one topic with concepts from other areas of the course. They encourage you to think across the subject and see the bigger picture.

        **Theory of knowledge (TOK)**
        TOK prompts highlight critical thinking and challenge you to consider how we know what we know. These features are designed to link your computer science studies to wider knowledge issues, offering opportunities for reflection and discussion.

        **AHL**
        Sections marked with AHL are designed for higher level study. They provide additional depth and complexity for students aiming to extend their understanding beyond the standard level.

        **Links**
        Links in the margins direct you to related parts of the companion where a concept is explored further or applied differently. They may also point you towards prior knowledge or new skills that will be useful for future learning.

        ### Developing skills

        **ATL (Approaches to learning)**
        ATL sections encourage you to strengthen essential skills such as communication, research, critical thinking, collaboration, and self-management. They help you apply strategies that are valuable both in computer science and across your studies.

        **Practical skills**
        Practical skills boxes focus on core abilities like algorithmic thinking and programming. They provide structured opportunities to apply theory in hands-on ways.

        **TPIP (This problem in practice)**
        TPIP examples show how computer science applies to solving real-world problems. They make abstract concepts concrete and highlight the relevance of your studies.

        **Internal and external assessment**
        These sections provide guidance on approaching your coursework and exam preparation. They focus on applying computational thinking to projects and preparing for Paper 1 and Paper 2.

        **Key term**
        Key term boxes introduce definitions of essential concepts and technical vocabulary, helping you build a strong foundation in computer science terminology.

        ### Practising

        **Worked examples**
        Worked examples present step-by-step solutions to model problem-solving approaches. Reviewing them helps you compare your own method with the given one.

        **Practice questions**
        Practice questions let you test your knowledge and check your progress. They help consolidate learning and prepare you for more advanced material.

        **Activity**
        Activities encourage you to apply knowledge in practical and interactive ways, often through problem-solving or creative exercises.

        **End-of-topic questions**
        At the end of each topic, you will find exam-style questions. These integrate the key concepts from the section, allow you to practise in exam conditions, and prepare you for assessments.
